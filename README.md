# Artefact
In the archive of International Institute of Social History there is a fascinating object. It is a plastic snow globe with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inside of it. The object even in it's purest, today's form already poses a multitude of questions and allows for various interpretations. However, what will happen with it in the future? How can we preserve a feeling of holding that snow globe when global warming already threatens the very existence of snow? And Marx - how does putting him in a tchotchke change his image and his ideology? What is the meaning of the snow globe's caption ('Schnee van gestern?')?

Asking (while not necessarily answering), those and other questions is the main premise of the Archival Resilience Project conducted in 2020 in KABK by its 40 students under supervision of Hannes Bernard and Martijn de Heer.

|![Original image on IISG website](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")| The image shows the original *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* as held in the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam. Transparent plastic globe with a flat, round, 3-legged base of black plastic contains a figure of sitting Karl Marx and standing Friedrich Engels next to him. The diameter of the base is around 12cm and the height of the globe around 10cm. Judging by the colour and texture, the figures are most probably made out of clay, however there is no firm proof, as the inside of the globe cannot be accessed. On the back of the box-shaped element Karl Marx is sitting on, there is an inscription "CLAY Genet". The inscription seems to be incised directly into the material by hand, not imprinted automatically. As the 'CLAY' part of the inscription could be a clue to the type of material used, the meaning of 'Genet' remains a mystery. In front of the figures, on the inner white base of the globe (on which the figures are positioned), the words 'Schnee van gestern!?' are printed in black ink in decorative script typeface. Both figures are submerged in soapy, murky water. Initially intended to fill out the whole globe, now the liquid reaches to only about half the height of the object. In the water there are floating particles of what seems to be small white plastic shavings. The snowglobe fits in human hand in order to facilitate shaking the object. When the globe is shook, the white plastic particles are supposed to imitate a snowfall, as after initial shake-induced blizzard-like chaos, gradually slowed down by the water resistance, they calmly travel back to the bottom of the object.

# Research

What constitutes this fascinating artefact is its eclecticism, the fact that on one hand the globe evokes feelings of nostalgia, calmness, lightness, while figures of Marx and Engels bring on certain political seriousness, remind the viewer of the controversial subjects of marxism and communism and their consequences. The connection of those two elements, together with baffling inscriptions, completes an image of an object that in its simplicity of form, is surprisingly complex and absurd.

In order to comprehensibly portray the richness, ridiculousness and metaphorical value of *Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* an explanation of its individual elements, history and socio-political context should be introduced first.

Essentially, any snowglobe can be divided into three parts: **the globe** itself, **the subject** (figure, picture placed inside of it) and **the inscription** or any textual content accompanying it (if there is any).

# The Globe

Preserving relatability of a snow globe logically starts with an explanation of what the clear subject matter, **snow** is.

## Snow

### Definitions

What the noun 'snow' can mean:
- atmospheric water vapour frozen into ice crystals and falling in light white flakes or lying on the ground as a white layer.
- precipitation in the form of small white ice crystals formed directly from the water vapour of the air at a temperature of less than 32°F (0°C)
- snow white - shade of colour white
- visual snow syndrome causes a person to see numerous flickering tiny dots that fill the entire visual field in both eyes
![Visual Snow](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
- a mass of flickering white spots on a television or radar screen, caused by interference or a poor signal (tv static snow)
![Static snow tv](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
![Static snow movement](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")
- cocaine, heroin (slang)


Etymology in different languages
- English snow, snaw, snāw (Old English)
- Proto-Germanic snaiwaz
- Proto-Indo-European snóygʷʰos
- West Frisian snie
- Dutch sneeuw
- German Schnee
- Danish sne
- Norwegian snø
- Swedish snö
- Icelandic snjór
- Latin nix
- Polish śnieg
- Russian снег
- Sanskrit स्नेह


### Water, Vapour, Ice

Snow consists of hexagonally bound molecules of water. It represents water's solid state of matter (created when 0 degrees Celsius or less is reached). It preserves the transformative value of the hydrogen-oxygen bonds, as it can sublimate back into liquid or gas state at a temperature above 0 Celsius.

### Global perspective

Thanks to global warming, naturally occuring snow is a vision gradually more and more rare. As much as mountain peaks are whitened with snow pretty much all year long, the majority of land lucky enough to be in cold/moderate climate, experiences a snowfall only in winter season. With the lowering of temperature, a chance of snowfall increases.

The warmer countries around equator, without any mountains are the ones least likely to experience snow. Of course, with global warming and all the glaciers melting, the number of countries without snow will gradually grow larger. For example, there used to be a small ski area called Chacaltaya on a tall mountain in Bolivia, but that ski area has already closed permanently because of lack of snow.

### Emotional charge

Snow can, depending on the cintext it appears in, evoke both positive and negative connections.

Generally speaking, snow operates on the border of seductive magicality and cold unapproachability, as shown below in a selection of pop-culturally established stories connected to strong presence of snow.

## Snowglobe

As snow exists somewhere between magical dust and natural disaster, so does an object of a snowglobe position itself on the border of cheap tchotchke and priceless memorabilia.

### Layers

Every snowglobe consists of the following layers:

**The Name**

known as snow domes , snow shakers, water domes, water balls, snow scenes and blizzard weights

**The Snow Material**

The ''snow'' was made of ground rice, bone, ceramic, camphor and wax or porcelain; today it is almost always tiny bits of plastic.

- isn't that accurate? it used to be snowing snow, but now, because of our need to own things, it snowing plastic.

how accurate is it that in the majority of mainstream snowglobes, which are supposed to be reminiscent of a magical event of snow globe, it already snows plastic (instead more natural materials like rice, wax, bone). Perhaps one day the snow on our Earth globe will follow. As the natural occurence of snow decreasee, the amount of plastic covering our planet increases.

One of our unique designs included a 120mm snowglobe on a solid silver base which was given to President Bill Clinton. The snowglobe **contained the original confetti which was thrown at his inauguration party.**

![Halloween](/assets/original.jpeg "Schnee von gestern?")

**The Liquid**

In the 1960's, several children got sick when they drank the contents of domes filled with polluted water taken directly from Hong Kong Harbor. In the 1950's, one manufacturer, finding that water froze when his inventory was being shipped, began adding antifreeze. Today, many manufacturers still add potentially lethal chemicals to prevent freezing and to thicken the water so the flakes drift through slowly.

**The Vessel**

In the early 1950's, plastic began to take the place of glass as a material for the globe itself.

# The Subject


# The Inscriptions







# Transcoding
The resilience of any archived object largely relies on its adaptability to a variety of media. Technology comes in, but also dies out at dizzying pace. Innovative technologies (CD, VHS), prevailing the market just 20 years ago are now considered out of date, which majorly impedes the process of retrieving the information held on them.

The artefact of *The Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* has been translated into different formats - using both coding and more analogue techniques of such inter-media translation. Every attempt at transcoding takes on a different aspect of the globe, analysing and preserving it, in hope that when viewed collectively, transcoded versions of the original will be able to reflect not only the physicality of the *The Snowglobe*, but also its socio-political relevance and emotional response it may have once evoked.

### Description


Short description here. You can structure the information and documentation for each transcoding, design research or coding tool as you like. It's important that you make clear the aims & goals of the transcoding, what methods and tools you use. If this is often the same across different transcodings, consider making a standardised table at the beginning of each.

You should include well-formatted documentation of your experiments and developments below. Someone without previous knowledge about your work should be able to follow along the steps, aims and results of your developments from this structure. Make sure all media used is correctly linked or embedded (images, PDFs, Videos, etc).

### Methods
Description of your methods, documentation of behind-the-scenes processes can go here. Think of the photos and videos you made when visiting the IISG or during captures of your artefact. You can use tools such as [Gifs.com](https://gifs.com/) to generate moving-image thumbnail to link to short videos.Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.  

With some HTML tags you can do simple styling in markdown, for example:

    <width="50%">
[<img src="https://j.gifs.com/ROJr3z.gif" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/o2rmmqxC4NU)

Remember to include the url link to jump to the full media, of course!


### Tools
Mention the tools that you used or made (if and when relevant).

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc.

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for.

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  


## Transcoding No. 2
### Description


### Disappearing snow

In the near future the word *snow* might become an anachronism. As global warming progresses, snow is more and more of a rare sight. And without its natural occurence, its relatability is lost. Phenomena like TV static/snow, visual snow or yesterday's snow would be named differently if snow did not exist anymore.

## Transcoding No. 3


| ELEMENT     | DESCRIPTION |
| :---        |    :----   |
| PURPOSE | Showing the possibilities the format of the snow globes offers for repurposing it as an object of new use. |
| METHOD | Arranging excerpts from Marx's *Kapital* into new sentences|
| LAYER | hhh |

https://ada-popovic.github.io/markdown_archive/capital/

Usually snow globe has only image-based content inside of it (as in pictures or sculptures). In this transcoding I would like to not only put words into the globe, but also through multi-level construction allow for arbitrary narrative creation. Each small globe within a greater construction would be similar to a Magic8Ball.

In an analogue version each globe would have a small transparent opening at the top and a dice inside of it. After the globe has been shook one of the sides of the dice floats to the top, revealing a word. Among other consecutive words a narrative is created.

In a digital version the construction would rely on randomly selected words from a few array (one array for each globe).


### Selection of quotes from *Das Kapital*

“Education is free. Freedoom of education shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by law and under the supreme control of the state”

“As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.10”

“Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.”

"Work, thrift and greed are therefore his three cardinal virtues."

Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc.

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for.

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  













# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)

## Bibliography
Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work.

<a name="footnote-1">**[1]**</a>: Look at this little referenced footnote over here. You can look up different text formats for referencing books, online articles, films etc.
