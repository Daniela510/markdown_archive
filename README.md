# Artefact
In the archive of International Institute of Social History there is a fascinating object. It is a plastic snow globe with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inside of it. The object even in it's purest, today's form already poses a multitude of questions and allows for various interpretations. However, what will happen with it in the future? How can we preserve a feeling of holding that snow globe when global warming already threatens the very existence of snow? And Marx - how does putting him in a tchotchke change his image and his ideology? What is the meaning of the snow globe's caption ('Schnee van gestern?')?

Asking (while not necessarily answering), those and other questions is the main premise of the Archival Resilience Project conducted in 2020 in KABK by its 40 students under supervision of Hannes Bernard and Martijn de Heer.

This is literally a description of what you see in the image, make sure its a clear, complete and concise overview of the artefact. It should make sense for someone who doesn't see the image itself.  Our final *Catalogue of Resilience* might make use of one representative image from each student, so important to put your moneyshot here. You can build a gallery of additional artefact images below.

# Research (H1)

This section consolidates the background research, context and any relevant information regarding your research **into** the artefact.

## Research Sub-Heading (H2)
Its important to give a clear structure to your Readme. Please use the document structure provided by markdown, so think of Headings, Sub-headings, text, bold/italic, lists (bullets and numbered), tables etc. You can also include some linked footnotes like this. <sup>[[1]](#footnote-1)</sup>

### Research Sub-sub-heading (H3)
The H3 heading is useful to define specific subsections within the H2 section. If you are in doubt about information structure, take a look at different wikipedia articles for reference.

# Transcoding
The resilience of any archived object largely relies on its adaptability to a variety of media. Technology comes in, but also dies out at dizzying pace. Innovative technologies (CD, VHS), prevailing the market just 20 years ago are now considered out of date, which majorly impedes the process of retrieving the information held on them.

The artefact of *The Snowglobe With Marx And Engels* has been translated into different formats - using both coding and more analogue techniques of such inter-media translation. Every attempt at transcoding takes on a different aspect of the globe, analysing and preserving it, in hope that when viewed collectively, transcoded versions of the original will be able to reflect not only the physicality of the *The Snowglobe*, but also its socio-political relevance and emotional response it may have once evoked.

## Transcoding No. 1
### Description
Short description here. You can structure the information and documentation for each transcoding, design research or coding tool as you like. It's important that you make clear the aims & goals of the transcoding, what methods and tools you use. If this is often the same across different transcodings, consider making a standardised table at the beginning of each.

You should include well-formatted documentation of your experiments and developments below. Someone without previous knowledge about your work should be able to follow along the steps, aims and results of your developments from this structure. Make sure all media used is correctly linked or embedded (images, PDFs, Videos, etc).

### Methods
Description of your methods, documentation of behind-the-scenes processes can go here. Think of the photos and videos you made when visiting the IISG or during captures of your artefact. You can use tools such as [Gifs.com](https://gifs.com/) to generate moving-image thumbnail to link to short videos.Just enough to give a clear overview, before getting into details.  

With some HTML tags you can do simple styling in markdown, for example:

    <width="50%">
[<img src="https://j.gifs.com/ROJr3z.gif" width="50%">](https://youtu.be/o2rmmqxC4NU)

Remember to include the url link to jump to the full media, of course!


### Tools
Mention the tools that you used or made (if and when relevant).

### Results
Some of your transcoding experiments may have smaller outcome sketches like images or short video tests. They can go directly within this section. Or maybe this transcoding became a part of the final outcome format. When that is the case, you can simply include a [hyperlink](#) to the final outcomes in the **Transcoding** section. In the final outcome section below you can embed or explain the final format outcome in detail.  

## Transcoding Tool
### Description
You might have made multiple coding tools during the semester. Or the transcoding tool might be part of a specific transcoding experiment itself. It's up to you to define the linear flow of the Readme. Just like the transcoding of media itself, the coding tool should be well documented. So if you are using a coding tool in your first experiment, include the documentation of the coding tool **before** you include the results, etc.

### Aims
Include the main aims or intentions behind making the tool, and what it is used for.

### Methods
This includes the coding languages, coding frameworks or libraries, and any platforms or webtools for example.   

### Results
The coding tool will vary a lot between different students. So depending on the use and type, you may include more or less documentation here.

### Source Links
Please include links to the tools, sources etc used during the coding. E.g. the resources used for making your coding tool.  


# Reflection
You might want to include a section about reflecting on the results of your coding and IMD experiments this semester. It can give additional context before reading the final outcomes below.

# Outcomes
This section will be different for each student, depending on how and what is formatted as a final result for the semester assignment. Nevertheless a clear written and documented outcomes is important. So give the appropriate subsections or formats to make this as thorough as possible.

### Outcome Links
Here you link to your final assignment outcomes. This could be a website, a video, etc etc. Please include links to the appropriate GitHub folder on your repository where your coding tool is stored.

This is the main way to access your IMD + Coding outcomes for the semester. So its very important that you check for bugs, troubleshoot hyperlink issues, embedded media issues etc. Please make sure you KNOW where each file you use is stored. E.g. If you migrated from Notion markdown into GitHub, its **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that Notion randomly stores images on an Amazon server. It changes those locations all the time. So if your main outcome or documentation is still grabbing those links, **its very likely** they might disappear before collectives. So please have all media and necessary files managed well in your own locations (online or github etc).   

# Conclusion
You might have a nice conclusive observation to share at the end :)

## Bibliography
Of course, as with all research work please include a good bibliography with links, and any references that were used or might give additional depth to the work.

<a name="footnote-1">**[1]**</a>: Look at this little referenced footnote over here. You can look up different text formats for referencing books, online articles, films etc.

Proposal of what the label put on the package could be. The title of the product ('Schnnee von gestern?') is teh same as the typography on th eoriginal artefact and the title of the archive. The barcode text was replaced with the original number of the artefact from the IISG archive.

![](/assets/T1/marx_model.jpg "Selection of materials")
3D model of Marx (to be printed)

### Questions:
- Should I just print one head of Marx or different size depending on the package?
- What do you think about the label?
- How could I use the barcode?

Usually snow globe has only image-based content inside of it (as in pictures or sculptures). In this transcoding I would like to not only put words into the globe, but also through multi-level construction allow for arbitrary narrative creation. Each small globe within a greater construction would be similar to a Magic8Ball.

In an analogue version each globe would have a small transparent opening at the top and a dice inside of it. After the globe has been shook one of the sides of the dice floats to the top, revealing a word. Among other consecutive words a narrative is created.

In a digital version the construction would rely on randomly selected words from a few array (one array for each globe).

### Selection of quotes from *Das Kapital*

“Education is free. Freedoom of education shall be enjoyed under the condition fixed by law and under the supreme control of the state”

“As, in religion, man is governed by the products of his own brain, so in capitalistic production, he is governed by the products of his own hand.10”

“Perseus wore a magic cap down over his eyes and ears as a make-believe that there are no monsters.”

"Work, thrift and greed are therefore his three cardinal virtues."

### Nouns

Singular
- education
- freedom
- law
- state
- religion
- brain
- hand
- perseus
- magic cap
- work
- thrift
- greed

Plural
- products
- virtues
