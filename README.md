# A snowglobe with Marx and Engels
## Preserving relatability of an object

***

In the archive of International Institute of Social History there is a fascinating object. It is a plastic snow globe with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels inside of it. The object even in it's purest, today's form already poses a multitude of questions and allows for various interpretations. However, what will happen with it in the future? How can we preserve a feeling of holding that snow globe when global warming already threatens the very existence of snow? And Marx - how does putting him in a tchotchke change his image and his ideology? What is the meaning of the snow globe's caption ('Schnee van gestern?')?

Asking (while not necessarily answering), those and other questions is the main premise of the Archival Resilience Project conducted in 2020 in KABK by its 40 students under supervision of Hannes Bernard and Martijn de Heer.

### Transcoding 1 - SPEED OF SNOW
### Transcoding 2 - TYPOLOGY OF TRANSPARENCY
### Transcoding 3 - SNOW GLOBE AS A STORYTELLING DEVICE

Usually snow globe has only imagery inside of it (as in pictures or sculptures). In this transcoding I would like to not only put words into the globe, but also through multi-level construction allow for arbitrary narrative creation. Each small globe within a greater construction would be similar to a Magic8Ball.

In an analogue version each globe would have a small transparent opening at the top and a dice inside of it. After the globe has been shook one of the sides of the dice floats to the top, revealing a word. Among other consecutive words a narrative is created.

In a digital version the construction would rely on randomly selected words from a few array (one array for each globe).
